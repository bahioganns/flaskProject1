# Overview
This program is basically my thesis. It's little and pretty simple program for flash content, which uses flash debugger from adobe.com to open swf files.  
This program uses Flask for interface with which I tried to simulate School KIO site.  

# Installation
This program is written with python3.9 and uses Flask.
To run it on your pc you have to clone it and install all required packages with requirements.txt  

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/bahioganns/flaskProject1.git  
cd flaskProject1  
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt  
```



# TODO: 
-[ ] Add icons for every KIO competition task
-[ ] Run KIO school tasks from /static/KIO_SCHOOL/. That files can not be run by flash debugger, and that's a huge problem
